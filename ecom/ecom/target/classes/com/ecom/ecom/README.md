# E_Com Project
In this project we have to know about the spring framework in detail. By using java and the spring the project should be done.

# Description
The Spring Framework Inversion of Control (IoC) component addresses this concern by providing a formalized means of composing disparate components into a fully working application ready for use. The Spring Framework codifies formalized design patterns as first-class objects that you can integrate into your own application(s). Numerous organizations and institutions use the Spring Framework in this manner to engineer robust, maintainable applications.

# Softwares  used
1) JAVA
2) Spring
3) XML Files of Spring

# Methods Used
1) Java Classes using inheritance
2) OOPS Concept
3) Java Functions & Methods.
4) Spring Methods
5) Components
6) Autowired
7) Overloading and Overiding.
8) Interfaces.
# Created Interface and  multiple class Files and Aquiring the properties of the methods in uinterface by using "implements" Keyword.
Name of the interface is Product, name of the classes are Clothes and ElectronicsItem.
#Implemented the concept of Method Overriding,Autowiring.
By using annotations @overriding , @Autowiring .
#Created methods , Setter methods and constructors.
#Created single oblject and passing multiple values.
#Passed values though Beans.xml file.

# Conclusion
By the end of the project the spring concept should be done and also you aware about the spring componets and XML files, Lastly you should know about the spring frameworks.
